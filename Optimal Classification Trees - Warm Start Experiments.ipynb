    "The following is an Julia 1.x implementation of the Optimal Decision Tree model developed by Bertsimas and Dunn in their [2017 paper](https://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/papers/Machine%20Learning%20under%20a%20Modern%20Optimization%20Lens/Optimal_classification_trees_MachineLearning.pdf).  Traditional Decision Tree models are perhaps the most easily interpretated classification model available to the data scientist. These models, however, suffer from the inherently greedy nature of their solving methods, which use a loss function at each level of depth for the Tree. This methodology is computationally efficient, but it gains that efficiency at the possible cost of accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the massive advances in both computational power and solver performance, it is now computationally feasible to compose a Decision Tree using a single loss function using Mixed Integer Optimization, ensuring that splits made in early branches of the tree generate the lowest possible error rates in the leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I begin reproducing this model by loading the needed Julia packages.  While I chose Gurobi for a solver, other MIO-compatible solvers can easily be deployed by changing the declaration below and then modifying the model delcaration appropriately."

Firstly, I will extract the label predictions for each leaf node $t_l$, then build a function that will test whether a given $x_i$ input fits into a given leaf node, and lastly, build an aggregate function that iterates over each leaf node and attempts to fit every point into a leaf node until a match is found.
