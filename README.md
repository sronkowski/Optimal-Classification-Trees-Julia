# Optimal Classification Trees in Julia

A Julia implementation of the Optimal Classification Tree and Optimal Classification Trees with Hyperplanes methods proposed by Dimitris Bertsimas and Jack Dunn in their [2017 paper](https://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/papers/Machine%20Learning%20under%20a%20Modern%20Optimization%20Lens/Optimal_classification_trees_MachineLearning.pdf).

At present, these notebooks are verified working for the "basic" OCT model; however, I have yet to verify the functionality of the code in the OCT-H model.  

To-Do List:

- Implement warm start function to greatly reduce solving times

- Develop additional result reporting functions
    - asdf
